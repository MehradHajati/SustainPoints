## **Sustainability Points – Scoring & Redemption Logic**

We convert transaction + utility data into a transparent **Sustainability Score** using fixed, auditable rules.

---

### **1. Green Debits (spending that’s good)**

**Public Transit**
- Monthly bus pass → fixed bonus (e.g. **+50 pts**).
- Transit reloads → **0.5 pts per \$**, capped per month to avoid abuse.

**Thrift / Refurbished / Second-hand**
- Extra points per \$ spent at verified “reuse” merchants.
- Encourages **circular economy** instead of buying new.

**Solar & Efficiency Upgrades**
- Strong points per \$ for solar / heat pump / efficiency installs.
- Lifetime cap so one purchase doesn’t dominate.

**Electricity (2 BHK baseline)**
- If bill ≤ baseline → higher points.
- Slightly above baseline → reduced points.
- Well above baseline → **0 pts**.

**Water (2 BHK baseline)**
- Same tiered idea as electricity with its own baseline.

_All of the above are tagged as `PointType = "DEBIT"` with clear categories (e.g., `BUS_PASS`, `ELECTRICITY`)._

### **2. Green Credits (money back for green actions)**

**Bottle / Container Returns**
- **3 pts per \$1** refunded.
- Rewards recycling without overpowering other actions.

**Green Rebates**
- Higher pts per \$ for official energy/efficiency rebates.

**Resale Earnings**
- Points for selling used items instead of discarding them.

_These are tagged as `PointType = "CREDIT"` so users can see how they earn their score._

### **3. Redemption**

Points can be redeemed only for **more sustainable choices**:

- **Transit rewards:** monthly/weekly passes, ride bundles.
- **Green vouchers:** thrift shops, low-waste/organic stores, efficiency/solar upgrades.
- **(Optional) Tax-style credit:** conservative conversion rate with an annual cap.

**Goal:** sustainable behaviour → points → rewards that make the next green choice easier.
