Idea Overview/Map:

Sustainability Points:

This idea aims at the Accessibility and inclusiviness portion of the hackathon.


Sustainability Points are motivators for people to spend and use with sustainability in mind.
Similiar to how air-miles or scene+ motivate you to spend when buying groceries and give you rewards after spending.

According to both the cateogory of spending and the amount spent, the user will get a corresponding sustainability point.


The user can then spend their points to:
1. Tax Redemption
2. Reduce price of EV vehicle
3. Reduce price of solar panels
4. Reduce price of insulation
5. reduce price of second hand goods
6. reduce price of public transporation passes


There are 4 cateogries of spending that a user can earn points from:

1. Purchasing Refurbished item such as second hand electronics or clothes

2. Paying for public transportation such as metro, bus, or tram

3. Purchasing items that promote renewable energy and energy conservation uses such as solar panels or good house insulation

4. Depending on how much money they have been able to save on utilities (water and power)
    Since each person and each household will have their own personal usage patterns we need to learn their usage patterns. 
    After we understand how their usage patterns, we can give them points when they are below their average usage.
    This feature would take a year to fully develop. Because of this the first month we will not give any points for this and then during the first year the points will be less than normal.
    Ideally we want the usage to update as the person changes and become more sustainable. so if they use 10% less power than last year, then earning points should become 10% harder next year.

5. Money earned from recyclying water bottles at stations
